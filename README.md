# Password Manager üîê

Hi! This program can generate passwords, storage, manage and view them. All passwords are encrypted to increase the protection, and are only decrypted when you pass the main password check.

# What libs do I need? 
<!---
```
 pip install PySimpleGUI
 pip install cryptography
 pip install pillow
 ```

Once you click on **Save**, it will return to main screen. If we click on **View Passwords** again, we can see the last password generated is there:

For safety, if you check the file where the passwords are stored, they are encrypted:

Future Features:
- MFA to increase security on login
- Better UI *(Not that easy to build good UI with PySimpleGUI)*
- View saved passwords on GUI ~~not terminal~~
- Add an edit/ modify login and a delete one, with security password to delete
- Add Update OTA (Over-the-air) to keeps the app updated
