# Password Manager üîê

Hi! This program can generate passwords, storage, manage and view them. All passwords are encrypted to inncrease the protection, and are only decrypted when you pass the main password check.

# What libs do I need? 
```
 pip install PySimpleGUI
 pip install cryptography
 pip install pillow
 ```


## Main code has these main functions


- View Passwords
- Generate Password (with # characters   selection)
- Save Password and Login
- Master Password to Start the program


### Hard coded - where you need to inform the path
So just replace these directories with the one you will be using to Convert/ OCR.
```
path 	= "C:\\Users\\vini_\\Desktop\\Script\\OCR\\img\\"
pdfpath = "C:\\Users\\vini_\\Desktop\\Script\\OCR\\pdf\\"
```


> **Tip:** It is better to have **2** separate **folders**, one for images and one for PDF.


## Testing the program! üë®‚Äçüíª
```
def  check_main_password(master_password): # actually main password is 'senha'
```
**Returns**:

**Returns**:

Once you click on **Save**, it will return to main screen. If we click on **View Passwords** again, we can see the last password generated is there:

For safety, if you check the file where the passwords are stored, they are encrypted:

Future Features:
- MFA to increase security on login
- Better UI *(Not that easy to build good UI with PySimpleGUI)*
- View saved passwords on GUI ~~not terminal~~
- Add an edit/ modify login and a delete one, with security password to delete
- Add Update OTA (Over-the-air) to keeps the app updated
